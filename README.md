# Deforestation Data Management System
## Project Overview
The Deforestation Data Management System is an advanced relational database designed to systematically collect, store, and analyze data related to deforestation in Nigeria. This database serves as a crucial tool for understanding the patterns, causes, and impacts of deforestation, thereby supporting informed conservation efforts and policy-making.

## Database Design
The core of this project is a relational database built using Microsoft SQL Server. The database is structured around five key tables, each meticulously designed to capture different aspects of deforestation and conservation activities. The schema supports comprehensive data management and analysis capabilities, which can be leveraged to address complex questions related to deforestation.

# Functionality and Use
The database has been populated with fictitious data to demonstrate its functionality. This data serves as a proof of concept, showcasing how the system can handle real-world scenarios and provide valuable insights. When real data is integrated, the system will be capable of:

### Analyzing Causes of Deforestation: 
Identify and categorize primary causes based on location-specific data.
### Mapping Deforestation Hotspots: 
Use spatial data to pinpoint regions with the highest deforestation rates.
### Assessing Biodiversity Impact: 
Evaluate the consequences of deforestation on local biodiversity through detailed records.
### Detecting Trends and Patterns: 
Perform temporal analysis to identify trends and shifts in deforestation activities.
### Evaluating Conservation Efforts: 
Assess the effectiveness of various conservation measures and identify regions in need of further intervention.

# Example Queries
